# Klever 3.6 (2022-06-26)

Klever 3.6 was released pretty soon after Klever 3.5 since we updated Clade and CIF in the backward incompatible manner.
This means that the new version of Klever requires all build bases to be regenerated with the new version of Clade and CIF installed together with Klever.
You can download build bases for Linux 5.5.19, 5.10.120 and 5.17.13 as well as sample build bases prepared ahead of time.
The [Klever tutorial](https://klever.readthedocs.io/en/v3.6/tutorial.html#preparing-build-bases) provides corresponding links.

Other changes in Klever 3.6 are new models for *struct_size()* and underlying *__ab_c_size()* for the Linux kernel.

# Klever 3.5 (2022-05-27)

We released Klever 3.5 that has following noticeable changes:

* Improving support for verification of Linux 5.10 and Linux 5.17 (new specifications set "5.17" was added).
* Environment models generated at verification of Linux loadable kernel modules do not contain infinite loops anymore.
  This accelerated analysis and did not result in any degradation in the quality of verification results.
* Using [Ubuntu 20.04](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes), [Debian 11](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes) and [openSUSE 15](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes).3 as preferable Linux distributions for deployment of Klever.
* Switching to Python 3.10.
  You should carefully read this [comment](https://forge.ispras.ru/issues/10937#note-7) if you are going to update existing local instances of Klever.
* Supporting regular expressions for assessing unsafes.
* Updating [Klever Tutorial](https://klever.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5/tutorial.html), in particular using verification of loadable kernel modules of Linux 5.5 as an example.
* Updating add-ons and verification back-ends (various bug fixes and optimizations).
* More advanced authorization of new users.
  Now the administrator should activate new users while somebody should grant them access to some jobs.

# Klever 3.4 (2022-02-24)

Klever 3.4 includes the following prominent features:

* Several improvements contributing development and generation of environment models:
  * Ability to specify savepoints for the main process.

* Besides, you can find the [CIFâ€™s user documentation](https://cif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) that may be helpful at development of advanced specifications and models.
* Many fixes and minor improvements that make the specification development and verification workflow more easy, correct and reliable.

# Klever 3.3 (2021-10-20)

The most noticeable work in Klever 3.3 is a new section [Development of Environment Model Specifications](https://klever.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev_env_model_specs.html) in the user documentation. Besides, there are following considerable improvements:

* Fixing allocation of memory for arguments of callbacks of several vital Linux device driver types.

# Klever 2.0 (2018-11-10)

Klever 2.0 implements ideas suggested in [[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74313-4_30)].
In general we added support for verification of software written in the GNU C programming language.
First examples of using Klever for software that differs from Linux device drivers are verification of Linux kernel subsystems [[2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-03427-6_19)] and [BusyBox](https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/clade) applets.
We are looking forward for more success stories!

Most important changes in Klever 2.0 are the following:

* Klever does not build programs under verification anymore.
  Instead it takes as input *build bases* that should be prepared with [Clade](https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/clade) in advance.
  This considerably speed ups verification when verifying the same software within different verification jobs.
  Also, this provides a more natural way to integrate Klever within a standard development life cycle.
* The generator of *program fragments* (former *verification objects*) includes abstract means suitable for various software as well as means for particular kinds of programs that allow to avoid considerable efforts for configuring program decomposition.
* The environment models generator consists of a number sub-generators that take specifications in suitable specific formats.
  This allows to simplify development of such the specifications very much.
  Besides, we fixed many existing and developed new environment model specifications both for new kinds of interactions between Linux kernel and BusyBox components and for new versions of the Linux kernel.
* The Klever interface provides users with a extremely useful online editor that enables changing configuration and specification files directly within the interface.

# Klever 1.1 (2018-09-05)

* Proper processing of wall timeouts that is especially important for highly overloaded machines.
* Advanced verification tasks scheduling allows:
  * Solving verification tasks faster by means of adaptation of computational resource limits.
  * Solving more verification tasks when having free computational resources after ensuring a minimally required quality of service.
* Getting rid of some database caches helps to avoid unpleasant bugs in various statistics.
* Considerable fixing and improving local and OpenStack deployments.
* Numerous minor bug fixes, optimizations and improvements.

# Klever 1.0 (2018-07-04)
