# Multiple Error Analysis (MEA) package, which is aimed at finding several bugs,
# violating the same property, by means of software model checking with minimal human interactions.
# This implementation is based on MEA theory, which was described in the paper
# "Checking several requirements at once by CEGAR" (https://doi.org/10.1134/S0361768816040058).
